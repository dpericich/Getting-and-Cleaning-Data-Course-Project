Peer-graded Assignment: Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This repository is a submission by Daniel Pericich for the Getting and Cleaning Data course project. This repository contains a script for analysis as well as a codebook describing how data analysis was performed

Dataset
Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones (Gathered by UCI)
URL - (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

Files
CodeBook.md - this codebook describes the variables, data and transformations of the intial data provided by UCI and the final product as predicated by course instructions

run_analysis.R - script that performs loading, variable declaration and cleaning and transformations used to complete the project description as listed below:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each    variable for each activity and each subject.
